Utilized AWS Rekognition for Final Attempt - awsSave.py

Tried to use FaceNet by completing MTCCN to find the faces then using InceptionResnetV1 model to get encodings and classify the images. The training and validation scores were great but was unable to get good test results. -betterModel.py has code that does everything for this and toImageFolder.py prepares training data to move all files to a folder of its class
